# My ZSH config
This config is a preconfigured package with oh-my-zsh. There are some dependencies, all are packed in, but need to be installed:
 
 - powerline fonts (`cd powerline-fonts; ./install.sh`)
 - solarized color theme for terminal - just a soft dependency, iterm2 already has it as a built-in optino

 To use this config, install the dependencies and then link `$HOME/.zshrc` to this package's `zshrc`.
